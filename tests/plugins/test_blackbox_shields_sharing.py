"""What a shield protects cannot leave the machine by a side door.

A shield's own findings are local-only (the registry marks them ``source="secret"``,
and the community gate refuses that source). Sharing is on by default, so three
other routes are pinned here:

* **Twins.** A core rule that matches a resource a shield protects raises its own
  finding, which is shareable. Each twin is found by asking the core file-access rule
  about every tested attack row aimed at a shield capability that claims findings or at
  a supported pack, then driven through the real pre-tool hook. The test pins what
  happens TODAY (the row's outcome, plus a heuristic core finding the community gate
  allows); what a twin should do is an open founder decision, so a change to it must
  come with a change here.
* **The manual report.** ``blackbox report`` accepts closed vocabularies only (the
  file categories, the report types, the indicator types); none may name a shield's
  finding kind, or an operator could hand-report what the shield keeps local.
* **One send path.** Only the reviewed modules may reach ``spawn_community_share`` or
  ``share_knowledge_asset``; a new automatic sender fails here until it is reviewed.
