"""Test helper: every registered shield's attack table joined with what each row does.

A shield ships the page's table (``shields/<id>/attacks.json``: title, how, outcome,
targets, evidence …), served by the registry as ``shields.attack_table(id)`` with
``systems`` and ``tested_with`` composed from its packs. What a row DOES — ``tool``,
``hook``, ``args``, ``graph``, ``block_severity`` — is test data in
``<id>_shield_attack_scenarios.json`` beside this file, keyed by row id: shipped attack
strings read as attacks to Hermes's plugin install scanner (catalog admission).

Usage::

    from _trader_attack_table import ATTACKS, TABLE   # Trader Shield's, as before
    from _trader_attack_table import TABLES
    for shield_id, joined in TABLES.items():
        local = [row for row in joined.attacks if row["proof"] == "test"]   # rows with their tool calls
