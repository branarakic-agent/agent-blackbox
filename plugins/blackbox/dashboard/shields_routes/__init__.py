"""The dashboard's side of shields: the settings each shield adds, and ``GET /api/shields``.

The kernel's settings stay shield-free (it never imports a shield); the dashboard composes
each shield's Settings view onto what the kernel answers, on GET and POST alike, so
the page re-renders from one shape. A sub-package because ``dashboard/`` is at its file
limit. The page draws every shield from these routes alone (``static/shields.js``); no
shield is named in the dashboard's own markup or script.

``GET /api/shields`` answers every registered shield's card (``shields.statuses()``) with
what the page needs to draw it — the shield's ``name``, ``tagline``, ``beta``, its ``page``
address and ``claims`` (the finding identifier patterns it owns, so the page can tell its
findings apart) — sanitised ONCE here, at the serving boundary (a shield clamps its own text but never
imports the dashboard), and served through the server's stale-while-revalidate cache for
:data:`STATUS_TTL_SECONDS`, so N shields cost one read per 2 s however many tabs poll.

``GET /api/shields/{id}/events`` answers that shield's full local events report
(``[ShieldEvent.as_json()]``, newest first; 404 for an id no shield is registered as),
sanitised once here too. Its text is the operator's OWN logs (redacted when logged), so it
is cleaned and clamped but not defanged — ``backup.tgz`` stays ``backup.tgz`` — and the
``identifier`` goes through ``safe_identifier``, the token the page hands back.

``GET /shields/{id}`` is the shield's explainer page, which reads everything else by
RELATIVE address: its prose (``/shields/{id}/content.json``), its tested attack
table (``/attacks.json``: the hand-written rows, ``systems`` and ``tested_with`` composed by
the registry, plus one generated row per browser folder rule, :func:`attacks_payload`), its figures (``/graph.json``, 404 for a shield that ships none) and its packs'
logos (``/packs/{pack}/logo.svg``). Every file is found through the registry from ``id`` and
``pack`` — a value no shield or pack is registered as is 404 before the filesystem is
touched — and a logo is served as an image, never a document: ``image/svg+xml``,
``nosniff`` and a sandboxing CSP, so an SVG opened directly runs nothing. The
campaign addresses ``/trader-shield``, ``/trader-shield/attacks.json`` and
``/trader-shield/graph.json`` are permanent 307 aliases with FIXED Locations, never
built from the request. All of it sits behind the app-wide browser boundary.

``GET /shields.js`` is the dashboard's shield code (``static/shields.js``, one fixed file).

Usage::

    return shields_routes.with_shields(settings.read_settings())   # GET /api/settings
    return shields_routes.with_shields(settings.write_settings(payload, validators=...))   # POST
    shields_routes.register(app, _swr)   # from dashboard.server.create_app
    shields_routes.events_payload("trader")   # -> [ShieldEvent.as_json()], or None for an unknown id
    shields_routes.attacks_payload("trader")  # -> the page's table with its browser-folder rows
