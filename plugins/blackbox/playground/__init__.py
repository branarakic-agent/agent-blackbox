"""The Playground: sandbox mode's test bench, built into the product (2026-10-21).

With **sandbox mode** on (``community_sandbox``, a switch under Community
sharing), every share this node makes goes to the community graph's
``sandbox`` lane instead of ``reports``, and the Playground lets the operator
send a real listed threat through the real check to prove the whole path —
membership, signing, the owner keeping the share, delivery to the other
members — with no consequence: no rule, flag or real log ever sees a test.
Switch sandbox mode off and the very next finding is real again.

Public surface (use only these):

* :data:`KINDS` — the test kinds (``package``, ``domain``, ``ip``, ``url``);
* :func:`run_test` — run one test, returns a :class:`TestResult`;
  raises :class:`PlaygroundRefused` with a plain reason when it cannot run;
* :func:`recent_tests` — this node's own sandbox findings, newest first;
* :func:`sandbox_activity` — the same tests as sessions → events → threats;
* :func:`sandbox_audit` — the same tests as Agent activity entries (``/api/audit``'s shape);
* :func:`read_lane` — what every member has shared to the sandbox lane;
* :func:`wallet_tests` / :func:`run_wallet_test` — the shields' self-tests for this machine
  (every wallet found here, generated seed phrases and keys), run through the real check,
  local only; they need sandbox mode but not sharing (:mod:`.wallets`);
* :mod:`graph` — that lane in the Community graph's own response shapes
  (``graph.graph_page``, ``graph.threat_detail``), for the dashboard in sandbox mode.

Usage::

    from plugins.blackbox import playground
    result = playground.run_test("domain")      # sandbox mode + sharing must be on
    view = playground.read_lane(load_blackbox_config())
