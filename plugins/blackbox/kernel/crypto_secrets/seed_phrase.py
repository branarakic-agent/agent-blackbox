"""BIP-39 seed phrases (a wallet's Secret Recovery Phrase) found in text.

A seed phrase IS the wallet: anyone holding the 12–24 words owns every
account behind it. MetaMask calls it the Secret Recovery Phrase (12 words);
most wallets accept 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24.

How a phrase is recognised (BIP-39, github.com/bitcoin/bips bip-0039):

* every word is on the 2048-word English list, which ships next to this file
  and is pinned by its SHA-256 (:data:`WORDLIST_SHA256`) — a changed or
  truncated list disables detection loudly instead of silently;
* the words stand together: anything that is not a letter may stand between
  them (spaces of any kind and length, commas, ``|``, ``&``, line breaks, list
  numbering, a web address's ``+``). Ordinary English breaks such a run within a
  few words ("the", "of", "is" are not on the list). The text is read through
  :func:`.text_view.normalised` first, so percent-encoding (``%2C``, ``%61``),
  invisible characters, fullwidth letters, HTML entities and CamelCase joins
  (``AbandonAbility…``) do not hide a phrase (KI-378); a word may also be written
  as its first four letters (BIP-39 makes them unique — the steel-backup form);
* a phrase may also be base64-encoded: a base64 run that decodes to text holding a
  phrase counts as that phrase. Other encodings (hex, rot13, reversed words) and an
  all-lower-case join with no separator ("abandonability…") are a known gap;
* the last word carries a checksum: of the n×11 bits the words encode, the
  final n/3 bits must equal the first bits of SHA-256 of the rest. A random
  run passes with probability 1/16 (12 words) down to 1/256 (24 words), so
  the checksum confirms a phrase rather than finding one.

What callers get, per run of 12+ list words (:class:`SeedPhraseRun`): where
it is, how many words, whether a checksum-valid phrase of a standard length is
inside it, whether a cue word is near ("seed", "recovery", "phrase", …) and
whether it is one of the published test phrases (uniform entropy, e.g.
"abandon … about"). Policy (block / flag) is the caller's.

Usage::

    for run in find_seed_phrase_runs(text):
        run.valid_words      # 12/15/18/21/24 when a checksum-valid phrase is inside, else 0
    redact_seed_phrases(text)  # every run of 12+ list words → [REDACTED_SEED_PHRASE]
